# Goated Grades Tracker

### Description:
  An application for tracking grades.

  As a university student, I am often worried about my grades. 
  Some professors are very quick with posting grades and making sure that they are actualy weighted 
  as they should on the universities official gradebooks (i.e. blackboard or canvas). But some 
  professors are not so kin on putting the grades up or the official gradebooks don't take other 
  factors into calculating the total grades. I wanted to make this application based on what I had
  found lacking in the official gradebooks.
